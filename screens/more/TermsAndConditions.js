          2. Consequences of Non-Payment {"\n"}2.1. Non-payment or late payment

          Information Companies (CICs), such as CIBIL, Equifax, Experian, and
          CRIF High Mark, may receive information about your non-payment or late

          affecting your ability to secure future loans. {"\n"}2.3. Your credit
          score, a numerical representation of your creditworthiness, may be
          adversely impacted by non-payment or late payment, making it difficult

          the right to pursue legal action to recover the outstanding debt in
          the event of non-payment. Legal action may involve initiating legal
          proceedings and potentially filing a police complaint against you for
          defaulting on the loan repayment. {"\n"}2.5. In cases of non-payment,
          Clearview Finance may assign recovery agents to visit your home and
          office for debt collection. Recovery agents will adhere to the
          boundaries of the law and maintain professionalism in their approach.{" "}
          {"\n"}2.6. Non-payment may result in adverse consequences, including

          measures to recover the outstanding amount as determined by court
          judgments. {"\n"}2.7. You may be responsible for covering the costs
          incurred during the debt recovery process, such as legal fees,

          future loans. {"\n"}3.2. Lenders consider credit history when
          assessing loan applications, and a negative credit history resulting
          from non-payment can lead to loan rejections or higher interest rates
          for future borrowing.
